[Decidim](https://decidim.org/) is an open-source platform for participatory democracy that enables citizens to influence in the creation of citizenship centric public policies and in the public agenda. At a global scale, over 150 institutions and organizations are using the software.

From the Decidim community, we know that the code creates normative frameworks and we want ours and its development to be more inclusive and diverse. Therefore, we foster the DecidmFemDev Programme, an open call for female and non-binary gender developers that seeks **parity in the development of the Decidim code, reinforcing and facilitating the participation of them in the platform**.

**Who can apply?**

Women and non-binary gender, that meet the following requirements:

* Ruby on Rails knowledge and Ruby on Rails (RoR) or Python and Django framework (focused on web development).
* Advanced English (written and spoken)
* Basic Spanish
* Be creative; the code needs it too
* We like Career Changers with great stories.
* Proactive, used to deadlines, responsible, able to commit to ongoing integration, clean code and good practices
* We are not looking for people with certain studies, but with certain abilities and skills!
* About 8-10 hours per week for 12 weeks of the programme
* Interest in Civic Tech projects

DecidimFemDev Programme offers:

* 2,000/grant for 12 weeks
* A mentor who will accompany the learning path in the development and creation of code for the Decidim platform.
* Ruby and RoR training with assorted materials
* Access to the DecidimFemDev job bank so that collaborating companies have preference when it comes to hiring.

**What is the DecidimFemDev Programme about?**

It supports the learning of Ruby on Rails among groups of developers through a scholarship programme that allows this increase in knowledge to be made compatible with other work.

**What is the Decidim FemDev Programme job bank?**

It is an initiative that starts this 2020 where decidim.org, encourages the hiring of female and/or non binary gender developers among the collaborating companies in order to achieve an increase of 10% of female and/or non binary gender developers among the members of the community of coders.

**What happens after the scholarship is over?**

We include contract clauses to the code development companies that work in the Decidim community and thus prioritize the scholarship recipients.

**What should I send?**

An e-mail with your CV attached and a brief explanation of why you are interested in participating in this scholarship.

**Is access to this scholarship compatible with other jobs and/or studies?**

Absolutely! You will only need to be available for short follow-up meetings each week and for mentoring. The rest of the time, you can work remotely.

**Who does the selection process?**

We developed this process as a result of the agreement between Decidim and DigitalFems, an NGO that promotes the presence of women in the digital environment. Both collaborate and manage the implementation of the gender parity programme in Decidim as well as the selection process.
