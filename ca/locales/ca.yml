    p1: Play around and explore freely the Decidim platform with our online demo.
    p2: Decidim is up and running on several instances that you can visit and explore, <a href="http://decidim.barcelona" target="_blank">Decidim Barcelona</a> at Barcelona City or you can visit the sites of <a href="https://participa.gavaciutat.cat/" target="_blank">Gavà</a> and <a href="https://www.lhon-participa.cat/" target="_blank">L'Hospitalet</a>. But these are real instances where you can't really play around freely, as you might not be a citizen of those municipalities, and you can't explore those sites as an admin.
    p3: If you want to go further you are welcome to test Decidim on our Decidim Demo Site (courtesy of our developers at <a href="http://alabs.org" target="_blank">aLabs</a>). Enter the demo site and freely explore the potential of Decidim and its features.
