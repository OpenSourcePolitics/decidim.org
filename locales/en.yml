  demo:
    title: Online Demo
    p1: Play around and explore freely the Decidim platform with our online demo.
    p2: Decidim is up and running on several instances that you can visit and explore, <a href="http://decidim.barcelona" target="_blank">Decidim Barcelona</a> at Barcelona City or you can visit the sites of <a href="https://participa.gavaciutat.cat/" target="_blank">Gavà</a> and <a href="https://www.lhon-participa.cat/" target="_blank">L'Hospitalet</a>. But these are real instances where you can't really play around freely, as you might not be a citizen of those municipalities, and you can't explore those sites as an admin.
    p3: If you want to go further you are welcome to test Decidim on our Decidim Demo Site (courtesy of our developers at <a href="http://alabs.org" target="_blank">aLabs</a>). Enter the demo site and freely explore the potential of Decidim and its features.
    p4: You can log in as <strong>Admin</strong> (username "<strong>admin@example.org</strong>" and password "<strong>decidim123456</strong>").

    q01:
      question: Can I join the Metadecidim community even if I don't live in Barcelona?
      answer: >-
        Decidim is a project that was born in Barcelona and that is why there is a
        strong territorial bond with this city. But yes, you can collaborate online,
        through participatory processes, debates, etc .... that we provide in
        Metadecidim. Although you might want to come to Barcelona sometime :)
